CS-465 Full Stack Development
## Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

In the frontend the singple page application(SPA) is used through the Angular which display the data to the customer while the express HTML are html request send from the backend into the fronted as well as javascript that is constantly being used within the frontend so that the module, controllers and request are properly being functional. The backend we use a NoSQL MongoDB database to allow data that is either structural or non structural to be stored which makes it flexible for developers.

## Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is a syntax that allows to serialize data types while Javascript is a programming language that gives dynamic to wed development, even thou javascript can possibly do the same things as a JSON the JSON just makes things easier and better when it comes to organizing data types. In the traveling web page we use difference instances such as edit-trip component and trip-card component to refactor code and this allows us for the overall functionality of the web to be rendiring data faster. The reuse of the UI component allows us to be less prone to getting issues or errors that might cause the overal website to not work.

## Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

method for request and retrieval that were use to test various type of API endpoints will be postman which allows us to check any reqeust as well as allow us to understand the authentications of the website. Within the projects the methods that we have used were the GET in order to request data stored either as a single instance or many, the POST method is able to allow us to insert new instances of trips in the website and the PUT method makes it possible for us to edit the metadata display in the website. The endpoints allow us to fully understand if the request are being properly functional and we can detect errors when testing these endpoints. The security in a full stack application is the one involved in keeping credentials working so that users have different levels of request.


## Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

In this course I have learned so much about the backend and the frontend of web developing as well as acquired knowledge on how to keep a website secure and also allow me to understand how to be efficient and scalable with code. My career will benefit fully on the creativity that comes with developing web and it will give me a boost of knowledge for any other challenges that might occur in the future.
